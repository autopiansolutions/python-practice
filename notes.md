# Notes

About This File

This file is my personal learning journal while studying Python and Computer Science fundamentals.
I use it to take notes, summarize concepts, and reflect on what I’ve learned.

### Welcome 

- Python is a programming language used to communicate commands to a computer.
- Commands are written in text files called programs.
- Running a program = computer reads → translates → executes instructions.
- Python is popular because it’s readable, versatile, and beginner-friendly.

### Comments


- Comments = text ignored by the Python interpreter.
- Created with #.
- Uses:
  - Provide context for why code is written a certain way.
  - Help others (or future you) understand code faster.
  - Temporarily disable a line of code without deleting it.

### Print

- `print()` makes the computer display information (**output**).  
- Messages must be inside **quotes** (`" "` or `' '`).  
- **Output** = what the program displays after running.  

### Strings

- A **string** is a block of text.  
- Defined by surrounding text with either:  
  - Double quotes: `"Hello world"`  
  - Single quotes: `'Hello world'`  
- Both work the same — just be consistent.

### Variables

- **Variables** store data for reuse.  
- Created with the assignment operator `=`.  
- Naming rules:  
  - No spaces or special symbols (except `_`)  
  - Cannot start with a number  
  - Can include numbers after the first letter (`cool_variable_5`)  
- Called “variables” because their values can be updated while keeping the same name.
- Variables can be **reassigned** to new values.  
- The variable name stays the same, but the stored value changes.  
- Useful when program context changes (e.g., greeting vs. goodbye).
