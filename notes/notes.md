# Notes

About This File

This file is my personal learning journal while studying Python and Computer Science fundamentals.
I use it to take notes, summarize concepts, and reflect on what I’ve learned.

## Hello World

### Welcome 

- Python is a programming language used to communicate commands to a computer.
- Commands are written in text files called programs.
- Running a program = computer reads → translates → executes instructions.
- Python is popular because it’s readable, versatile, and beginner-friendly.

### Comments

- Comments = text ignored by the Python interpreter.
- Created with #.
- Uses:
  - Provide context for why code is written a certain way.
  - Help others (or future you) understand code faster.
  - Temporarily disable a line of code without deleting it.

### Print

- `print()` makes the computer display information (**output**).  
- Messages must be inside **quotes** (`" "` or `' '`).  
- **Output** = what the program displays after running.  

### Strings

- A **string** is a block of text.  
- Defined by surrounding text with either:  
  - Double quotes: `"Hello world"`  
  - Single quotes: `'Hello world'`  
- Both work the same — just be consistent.

### Variables

- **Variables** store data for reuse.  
- Created with the assignment operator `=`.  
- Naming rules:  
  - No spaces or special symbols (except `_`)  
  - Cannot start with a number  
  - Can include numbers after the first letter (`cool_variable_5`)  
- Called “variables” because their values can be updated while keeping the same name.
- Variables can be **reassigned** to new values.  
- The variable name stays the same, but the stored value changes.  
- Useful when program context changes (e.g., greeting vs. goodbye).

### Errors

- Since humans make mistakes, programming languages help us identify and fix them.  
- In Python, mistakes are called **errors**.  
- Python will show where an error occurs using a `^` character.  
- Unexpected errors are called **bugs**.  
- The process of fixing these is called **debugging**.  

**Common Error Types:**  
- **SyntaxError**:  
  - Problem with code structure.  
  - Examples: missing parenthesis, misplaced punctuation, wrong command placement.  

- **NameError**:  
  - Python doesn’t recognize a word.  
  - Happens when using a variable that hasn’t been defined.

### Numbers

- **Integer (`int`)**  
  - Whole numbers (no decimals).  
  - Includes positive, negative numbers, and 0.  
  - Examples: counting people, jellybeans in a jar, keys on a keyboard.  
  - Example: `5`, `-12`, `0`  

- **Floating-point number (`float`)**  
  - Numbers with decimal points.  
  - Used for fractions and precise measurements.  
  - Examples: wall length, average test score, baseball batting average.  
  - Example: `3.14`, `-0.5`, `42.0`

 ### Calculations
 
 **Basic Arithmetic in Python:**  
- Addition: `+`  
- Subtraction: `-`  
- Multiplication: `*`  
- Division: `/`  

### Exponents

Python can perform exponentiation (raising numbers to a power) using the `**` operator.  

- Exponentiation is written with `**` (instead of superscripts)

### Modulo 

The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder after dividing one number by another.  
 
- If two numbers divide evenly, the result is `0`.
