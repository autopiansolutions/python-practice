# Python Practice 

Welcome to my **Python Practice repository**!  

This repo contains code Iâ€™ve written while learning Python 3 through Codecademy lessons, experiments, and personal exercises. 

It serves as both a **learning log** and a way to track my growth as I work toward becoming a freelance developer.



## Repository Structure
- `basics` â†’ Variables, loops, conditionals, functions  
- `data_structures/` â†’ Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples  
- `projects` â†’ Small practice projects (games, utilities, scripts)  
- `notes` â†’ Reflections and key takeaways from each lesson  



## Goals
- Strengthen my Python 3 fundamentals  
- Build a portfolio of practice projects  
- Prepare for freelancing as a computer science student  
- Long-term: work as a freelance developer in the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±  



## Tools
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Editor:** VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  



## Progress
This repository will continue to grow as I complete more lessons and start building small projects.  
Stay tuned for updates as I move from basic exercises to real-world applications!
